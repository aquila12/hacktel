modems correctly, information could be  
transferred half-duplex. Bulletin       
boards could be run on systems such as  
the BBC Micro, and would present        
themselves in the same manner as an IP. 
                                        
The modem standard - v.23 - used        
for viewdata is asymmetric. The forward 
channel (download) runs at 1200 bits    
per second (120 characters per second   
taking framing into account), while the 
reverse channel (upload) runs at 75     
bits per second (7.5 characters per     
second). A terminal - apart from any    
storage functionality - is relatively   
"dumb", and transmits key presses       
immediately. The information            
provider's system reacts as needed      
- whether this means sending a new
